## Aims of the site.

Record my daily notes, including:
- Explain in a more popular way some of the content on [oi-wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/) that is not friendly to beginners (such as me).
- Some exercises from English, math and programming courses
- Some notes from ZJU courses.

## How can I contribute to this project?

Raise an discussion on the website I deploy, send me an email or PR. I will review and modify it regularly. However, because I am usually very busy, it may take a month to reply to your feedback.

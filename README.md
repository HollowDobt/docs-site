# Hollow's Library ~

> Hello? This is [my own data base](https://docs.hollowlib.top). Nice to see you here!

## Talks: Dark History & Birght Future of this Data Base

I have tried many frameworks, but they are often too complicated to use, especially when I need to create a new article. In addition, other forms of document frameworks always lack some of the plug-ins I need. [Mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) should be the final framework used by my document site, and it will not be changed in the future.

## Aims of the Base

Alternative note taking software to record some of my university study notes. I don't major in CS, but I have a strong interest in it, especially the algorithm. So there will also be a lot of articles related to computer science here

## Plans

- Complete the basic settings of the website to ensure that mathematical formulas can be displayed according to normal typesetting rules.
- Override some layout files to make the document page style consistent with the homepage style.
- Use the original elements of material to make the page richer.
